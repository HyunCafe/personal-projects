     <h2 class ="title-thought"> My Thought Process for this Website and getting into Programming </h2>

     <p class="thought"> Sometimes the hardest part of a project is getting started, and once you sit down and start working finally, you've finished half the battle already.
        So I tried to tackle this First Official Project in the same way I approached trying to learn to code in general.

        <ul class="thought-list">
            <li> First, I created a general outline of what I wanted. I started with the theme, something I'd enjoy, Studio Ghilbi!</li>
            <li> List of Ideas.. Adding Weather Widget App </li>
            <li> Adding Content from favorite list of websites to learn programming </li>
            <li> List to a bunch of great tools for learning and productivity </li>
            <li> Gacha Game Type thing </li>
        </ul>
     </p>
